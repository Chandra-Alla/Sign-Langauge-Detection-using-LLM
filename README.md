# Project Title

Welcome to the Sign Language Detection Project! This project is designed to facilitate communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating sign language into text in real-time. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our system interprets video input to recognize and translate sign language gestures accurately.

Key Features
Real-Time Translation: Translates sign language into text instantaneously, allowing for seamless communication.
Advanced Machine Learning Models: Combines CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal dynamics understanding, enhancing accuracy and reliability.
Customizable Interface: User-friendly interface that can be tailored to individual preferences and needs.
Extensive Training Dataset: Developed using a custom dataset to cover a wide range of signs and ensure robust performance across diverse conditions.
Benefits
Enhanced Accessibility: Provides a vital communication tool for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, enabling better access to education, services, and social interactions.
Learning and Education: Supports learners of sign language by providing real-time feedback and translation.
Community Engagement: Bridges the gap between the deaf community and the hearing world, promoting inclusivity.
Usage
This system is intended for educational purposes, as well as practical application in real-world environments. It can be integrated into various platforms and devices, offering a versatile tool for communication and learning.

Thank you for exploring our project. We hope it serves as a valuable resource in enhancing communication accessibility and fostering connections within and across communities.
